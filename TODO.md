- [ ] Quick presentation on `enumeratum`
  - problems with Scala Enums
    - exhaustiveness checks
  - problems with regular Scala ADTs
    - parsing
    - listing
    - conversions
  - advantages of enumeratum
    - no dependencies, 
    - even faster than `Enumeration` (from standard library!)
    - enums can be objects with methods, attributes, etc.
    - no use of reflection at runtime (so fast)
    - ... others
  - examples
    - [here](https://github.com/mauriciojost/main4ino-server/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/mauritania/main4ino/security/Permission.scala)
- [ ] Quick presentation on `pureconfig` use as parameters for an application
  - what our configuration management code often looks like
  - what could it look like
  - overwrite configuration settings, example
  - quick intro to pureconfig
  - quick intro to the use of pureconfig for args 
  - example

- [ ] Quick presentation on `refined`
  - why type safety matters
  - where Scala default types fall short
  - where `refined` helps
  - examples
    - show the lack of stupid checks (nullity, greater than zero, port in [0-65535], ...)
  - integrations
    - pureconfig
- [ ] Quick presentation on `Scala Steward`
  - the beauty of libraries upgraded
