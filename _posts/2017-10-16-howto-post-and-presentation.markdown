# Post or slides?

Presentations are great. Blogs too.

Which one do I dedicate my time to?

<!--slide-next-->

Why choosing? Write **both at once**!

<!--slide-next-->

In this special **post/presentation**, I will give you an example with sources
on how to build your own blog posts, and generate both:

- a post, and
- a presentation

from a single markdown file.

<!--more-->

<!--slide-ignore-begin-->

You can have text that will be ignored in the slides, but written in the
post, so you can go more into details where it really matters.

<!--slide-ignore-end-->

<!--slide-next-->

# Second slide

This is an example of an horizontal slide.

<!--slide-next-->

# Third slide

Another one.

<!--slide-down-->

## Third A

A vertical slide (I use them for continuation of the upper slide).

<!--slide-down-->

## Third B

Yet another one.

<!--slide-next-->

## References

[]()

# Enjoy!
